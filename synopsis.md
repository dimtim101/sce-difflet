### Difference Between - SCE505 Web2py Project

Core Idea is to display difference between any two entities belonging to same category. Users can create categories, topics, entities and subjects to differentiate between.

A user select two topics within a category and a page is displayed outlining the differences between those two topics point by point. 

A summary section would also be display to convey information about the topics that don't directly fit as differences between the topics.

The initial data for a topic would be entered by user, which can be progressively updated by other users as well. The site would be providing customizable forms i.e. a subject to differentiate on can be created by user.

There would also be user signup/login, where users can upvote, downvote, suggest edits.
